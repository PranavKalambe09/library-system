            <li>A library is referred to as a 'social institution' and a 'service institution', which
serves the current as well as life-long learning needs of the society. In the Trinity,
(1) The universe of knowledge containers include information sources in
various formats (print, non-print and electronic media),
(2) The universe of knowledge seekers include various groups in society
(children, women, students, teachers, researchers, patients in hospitals,
prisoners in jails, and others), and
(3) The universe of facilitators (library staff) include providers of various library
services (technical services, users services, and others).

            <li>A library performs a number of specialized activities. Based on each specialization,
the library work is divided into various sections. Let us know about the functions
of the sections in a library. </li>
